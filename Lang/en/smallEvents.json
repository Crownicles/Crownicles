Elle renforce toutes vos capacitÃ©s - attaque, dÃ©fense, vitesse - et voici un secret que j'ai appris au fil des ans : plus vous patientez avant de l'utiliser, plus l'augmentation de vos statistiques sera spectaculaire.",
      "{emote:fightActions.boomerangAttack} L'attaque boomerang, une technique que j'ai eu l'occasion d'observer au cours de mes annÃ©es de service ! Elle peut infliger jusqu'Ã  deux retours de dÃ©gÃ¢ts sur votre adversaire, comme si elle revenait sur sa trajectoire. Imaginez votre arme qui revient frapper une seconde fois aprÃ¨s le premier impact - c'est exactement ce qui se produit avec cette manÅuvre.",
      "{emote:fightActions.boulderTossAttack} L'attaque rocheuse, voilÃ  une technique brutale mais efficace ! Elle inflige des dÃ©gÃ¢ts moyens Ã  cause de la petite taille des rochers, mais attention jeune aventurier : si elle touche sa cible, elle peut Ã©tourdir complÃ¨tement l'adversaire. J'ai vu des combats se dÃ©cider sur ce coup de chance.",
      "{emote:fightActions.breathTakingAttack} Le vol de souffle est une manÅuvre sournoise que j'ai apprise en observant certains de mes adversaires les plus rusÃ©s ! Elle inflige une faible quantitÃ© de dÃ©gÃ¢ts mais peut voler le souffle de votre adversaire ou mÃªme le ralentir dans ses mouvements. Ne sous-estimez jamais l'impact de priver un ennemi de sa respiration.",
      "{emote:fightActions.canonAttack} L'attaque canon, ah ! VoilÃ  une technique complexe que j'ai eu l'occasion d'Ã©tudier longuement. Sa prÃ©cision baisse considÃ©rablement sur les adversaires rapides, mais elle reÃ§oit un bonus de dÃ©gÃ¢ts contre les adversaires trÃ¨s lents. Elle peut ralentir l'ennemi et, fait intÃ©ressant, devient plus puissante si vous l'utilisez plusieurs fois de suite.",
      "{emote:fightActions.chargingAttack} L'attaque chargÃ©e, une de mes favorites pendant mes annÃ©es de service ! Elle se dÃ©roule en deux temps prÃ©cis : le premier coup inflige des dÃ©gÃ¢ts tout en renforÃ§ant votre dÃ©fense, puis le second coup la diminue Ã  nouveau, tout en se dÃ©chaÃ®nant sur votre adversaire. Il faut savoir gÃ©rer ce flux et reflux de protection.",
      "{emote:fightActions.clubSmashAttack} Le coup de massue demande de la patience, jeune combattant ! Cette technique nÃ©cessite exactement un tour de prÃ©paration, puis frappe l'adversaire avec un coup d'une puissance remarquable. J'ai appris que l'anticipation fait toute la diffÃ©rence dans l'efficacitÃ© de cette attaque.",
      "{emote:fightActions.concentration} La concentration, voilÃ  une technique mentale que tout vÃ©tÃ©ran doit maÃ®triser ! Attention cependant : elle Ã©choue si vous l'utilisez alors que vous Ãªtes affectÃ© par une altÃ©ration d'Ã©tat. Si elle rÃ©ussit, l'altÃ©ration \"concentrÃ©\" augmente considÃ©rablement les dÃ©gÃ¢ts que vous infligerez lors du prochain tour.",
      "{emote:fightActions.counterAttack} L'attaque riposte, l'essence mÃªme du combat tactique ! Cette technique rÃ©plique avec la mÃªme action que celle que vient de jouer votre adversaire. Mais attention : elle ne fonctionne pas sur la magie ou les actions des dieux, ni si l'adversaire n'a pas attaquÃ©, cela va de soi. J'ai toujours dit que l'observation Ã©tait la clÃ© du combat.",
      "{emote:fightActions.cursedAttack} L'attaque maudite, une technique que j'ai vue employÃ©e par des adversaires particuliÃ¨rement retors, un sort nÃ© de l'accumulation de toute la rancÅur de ce monde. Elle maudit l'adversaire pour qu'il en subisse les consÃ©quences dans le futur. Fait remarquable : elle vous soigne si l'adversaire a encore beaucoup d'Ã©nergie au moment oÃ¹ l'attaque est utilisÃ©e.",
      "{emote:fightActions.darkAttack} L'attaque sombre, redoutable et imprÃ©visible ! Ce sort est nÃ© de l'accumulation des forces les plus obscures de ce monde, et seul un combattant ayant plongÃ© ses yeux dans l'abÃ®me de la magie peut espÃ©rer l'utiliser. Elle utilise la puissance de l'adversaire pour se renforcer tout en ignorant sa dÃ©fense. Elle peut vous rendre une partie de votre souffle perdu ou aveugler l'ennemi. L'aveuglement rend parfois l'adversaire incapable d'attaquer, tout en rÃ©duisant sa dÃ©fense et sa vitesse.",
      "{emote:fightActions.defenseBuff} Le renforcement de dÃ©fense, une technique d'accumulation que j'ai souvent enseignÃ©e Ã  mes recrues ! Plus cette action est effectuÃ©e Ã  la suite, plus le bonus de dÃ©fense devient important. La persÃ©vÃ©rance paye toujours en matiÃ¨re de protection.",
      "{emote:fightActions.divineAttack} L'attaque divine, puissante mais exigeante ! Seuls les combattants ayant Ã©prouvÃ© leur patience et leur persÃ©vÃ©rance auprÃ¨s des dieux pourront goÃ»ter la pleine saveur de son pouvoir de destruction. Sa prÃ©cision augmente avec la durÃ©e du combat. Elle fait partie du groupe des \"actions des dieux\" et Ã©choue si deux actions divines ont dÃ©jÃ  Ã©tÃ© effectuÃ©es dans le combat.",
      "{emote:fightActions.energeticAttack} L'attaque Ã©nergique, voilÃ  une technique que j'apprÃ©cie particuliÃ¨rement ! Elle soigne l'attaquant de la moitiÃ© des dÃ©gÃ¢ts infligÃ©s, et ignore mÃªme une partie de la dÃ©fense. C'est ce que j'appelle une manÅuvre qui nourrit le combattant, mais prenez garde : sa prÃ©cision diminue avec les utilisations, et j'ai observÃ© que son pouvoir curatif s'Ã©puise aprÃ¨s trois utilisations et qu'il est moins efficace contre les monstres.",
      "{emote:fightActions.eruptionAttack} L'Ã©ruption, une dÃ©monstration de puissance Ã©lÃ©mentaire impressionnante ! Elle fait entrer en Ã©ruption le volcan qui crache des rochers en fusion. D'aprÃ¨s mon expÃ©rience, seuls les plus rapides pourront Ã©viter les dÃ©gÃ¢ts de cette catastrophe contrÃ´lÃ©e.",
      "{emote:fightActions.familyMealAttack} Le repas de famille, une technique pour le moins... originale ! Elle appelle des alliÃ©s pour infliger des dÃ©gÃ¢ts Ã  l'adversaire et l'empoisonner. Le lanceur devient alors repu, remplaÃ§ant une potentielle altÃ©ration d'Ã©tat dont il serait victime. J'ai vu bien des choses Ã©tranges au combat, mais celle-ci reste mÃ©morable !",
      "{emote:fightActions.fireAttack} L'attaque feu est une des compÃ©tences les plus redoutables qu'il m'ait Ã©tÃ© donnÃ© de contrer. Ce pur concentrÃ© infernal de puissance et de chaleur se dÃ©verse sur l'adversaire, le calcinant ensuite sur un ou plusieurs tours supplÃ©mentaires grÃ¢ce Ã  l'altÃ©ration \"brÃ»lÃ©\". MÃ©fiez-vous des combattants qui la maÃ®trisent ! Si c'est vous qui la maÃ®trisez, utilisez cette attaque si vous Ãªtes gelÃ© pour vous rÃ©chauffer !",
      "{emote:fightActions.grabAndThrowAttack} L'attaque projection, une technique de corps Ã  corps que j'ai souvent vue en action ! Si le dÃ©fenseur a eu l'audace d'utiliser une attaque physique, l'attaquant peut l'attraper et le plaquer sur le rocher le plus proche, ce qui peut l'Ã©tourdir en plus de lui infliger des dÃ©gÃ¢ts. Le timing est crucial pour cette manÅuvre.",
      "{emote:fightActions.guildAttack} L'attaque de guilde, l'illustration parfaite de la force du groupe ! Les membres de la guilde se rÃ©unissent pour rÃ©aliser une attaque groupÃ©e d'une puissance remarquable. Cela me rappelle les formations de ma garde royale.",
      "{emote:fightActions.hardBiteAttack} La morsure puissante, brutale et directe ! Elle inflige des dÃ©gÃ¢ts tout en faisant saigner l'adversaire. J'ai appris Ã  me mÃ©fier de toute crÃ©ature capable d'une telle fÃ©rocitÃ© primitive. Si jamais vous vous mettez Ã  saigner, un peu de repos vous soignera.",
      "{emote:fightActions.heavyAttack} L'attaque lourde est Ã  la fois subtile et brutale. Elle s'Ã©crase avec force sur la dÃ©fense de votre adversaire, la brisant sous ses coups puissants, arrachant Ã  l'adversaire un quart de sa protection. Cependant, j'ai pu remarquer qu'elle Ã©chouait constamment lorsque l'attaquant avait plus de dÃ©fense que son opposant.",
      "{emote:fightActions.intenseAttack} L'attaque intense, Ã©puisante mais potentiellement dÃ©vastatrice ! Elle n'Ã©choue jamais sur un adversaire plus rapide et fonctionne mieux sur un adversaire rapide. Attention cependant : elle force le lanceur Ã  se reposer au tour suivant et ne peut pas tuer l'adversaire. J'ai pu aussi remarquer qu'elle Ã©tait beaucoup moins efficace face Ã  une dÃ©fense Ã©levÃ©e.",
      "{emote:fightActions.heatDrainAttack} Le drain de chaleur, une technique que j'ai observÃ©e chez certains adversaires monstrueux ! Elle rÃ©cupÃ¨re la chaleur du joueur, ce qui augmente l'attaque du lanceur et gÃ¨le l'adversaire. Fascinant de voir comment la tempÃ©rature peut devenir une arme. Si vous Ãªtes gelÃ©, vous serez ralentis et vous subirez des dÃ©gÃ¢ts.",
      "{emote:fightActions.heatMudAttack} L'attaque boue brÃ»lante, une ingÃ©nieuse exploitation de l'environnement ! Elle chauffe la boue prÃ©sente dans l'arÃ¨ne pour faire des dÃ©gÃ¢ts et fonctionnera mieux sur les adversaires sales. J'ai toujours Ã©tÃ© fascinÃ© par ces monstres qui se sont adaptÃ©s Ã  leur environnement.",
      "{emote:fightActions.lavaWaveAttack} La vague de lave, une attaque de dernier recours d'une puissance terrifiante ! UtilisÃ©e par certains monstres quand ils se sentent menacÃ©s, ce pur concentrÃ© infernal de puissance et de chaleur se dÃ©verse sur l'adversaire, le calcinant ensuite sur un ou plusieurs tours grÃ¢ce Ã  l'altÃ©ration \"brÃ»lÃ©\".",
      "{emote:fightActions.magicMimicAttack} L'attaque mimique magique, brillante dÃ©monstration d'adaptation ! Elle permet de riposter aprÃ¨s une attaque de l'adversaire. La riposte sera bien meilleure si l'adversaire vient d'utiliser une attaque magique. L'art d'utiliser la force de l'ennemi contre lui-mÃªme.",
      "{emote:fightActions.magmaBathAttack} Le bain de magma, technique de rÃ©cupÃ©ration pour le moins... extrÃªme ! Le lanceur se repose dans la lave et rÃ©cupÃ¨re son Ã©nergie. Attention cependant : son pouvoir curatif est fortement diminuÃ© aprÃ¨s quatre utilisations.",
      "{emote:fightActions.mudShotAttack} Le tir de boue, attaque Ã  distance simple mais efficace ! Elle inflige des dÃ©gÃ¢ts tout en rendant l'adversaire sale. C'est une technique que j'ai souvent vue employÃ©e par les monstres des marais. La saletÃ© peut Ãªtre un atout dans un combat, car elle augmente les dÃ©gÃ¢ts lÃ©gÃ¨rement et vous protÃ¨ge d'autres altÃ©rations d'Ã©tat mais elle rend Ã©galement plus vulnÃ©rable Ã  certaines attaques.",
      "{emote:fightActions.outrageAttack} La colÃ¨re, technique Ã©motionnelle puissante mais risquÃ©e ! Elle Ã©choue si vous l'utilisez alors que vous avez une altÃ©ration d'Ã©tat. L'altÃ©ration \"en colÃ¨re\" double l'attaque mais baisse la dÃ©fense. Au bout de deux tours, l'effet disparaÃ®t et l'attaquant devient confus. J'ai vu beaucoup de combats perdus Ã  cause d'une colÃ¨re mal maÃ®trisÃ©e.",
      "{emote:fightActions.petrificationAttack} La pÃ©trification est une technique de contrÃ´le redoutable, car elle pÃ©trifie la cible pendant deux tours tout en doublant sa dÃ©fense. Un adversaire immobilisÃ© mais renforcÃ© - il faut savoir en tirer parti intelligemment.",
      "{emote:fightActions.piercingAttack} L'attaque perÃ§ante, la spÃ©cialitÃ© des fins stratÃ¨ges ! Elle ignore presque complÃ¨tement la dÃ©fense de l'adversaire. L'attaquant a une probabilitÃ© de rÃ©duire lÃ©gÃ¨rement la dÃ©fense de son adversaire. Chaque coup compte dans cette technique.",
      "{emote:fightActions.poisonousAttack} L'attaque empoisonnÃ©e a Ã©tÃ© dÃ©veloppÃ©e par les alchimistes les plus douÃ©s du royaume. J'ai pu apprendre dans les archives de la cour que son poison est tirÃ© du venin de nombreux animaux, mais sa composition exacte reste un mystÃ¨re. Elle empoisonne l'adversaire avec une altÃ©ration qui dure au moins trois tours et inflige des dÃ©gÃ¢ts sur la durÃ©e. J'ai aussi pu remarquer que cette attaque est beaucoup plus efficace en dÃ©but de combat !",
      "{emote:fightActions.powerfulAttack} L'attaque puissante, risquÃ©e mais potentiellement dÃ©vastatrice ! Elle rÃ©duit la vitesse de l'adversaire et peut faire plus de dÃ©gÃ¢ts, au prix d'un Ã©tourdissement de l'attaquant. Attention : aprÃ¨s trois utilisations, les dÃ©gÃ¢ts de l'attaque sont rÃ©duits. Il faut donc apprendre Ã  l'utiliser au bon moment pour optimiser son efficacitÃ©.",
      "{emote:fightActions.protection} La protection, technique dÃ©fensive que j'ai enseignÃ©e Ã  tous mes fantassins ! Elle Ã©choue si vous l'utilisez alors que vous avez une altÃ©ration d'Ã©tat. L'altÃ©ration \"protÃ©gÃ©\" dure trois tours et vous empÃªche d'Ãªtre victime d'une autre altÃ©ration tout en offrant un boost de dÃ©fense.",
      "{emote:fightActions.quickAttack} L'attaque rapide, parfaite contre les adversaires lents ! J'ai souvent eu affaire Ã  de vils assassins qui en voulaient Ã  ma vie, et j'ai rÃ©guliÃ¨rement eu Ã  faire face Ã  cette technique. Elle n'Ã©choue jamais sur un adversaire plus lent et plus celui-ci est lent, plus cette attaque lui fera des dÃ©gÃ¢ts. La vitesse a toujours Ã©tÃ© un atout majeur au combat.",
      "{emote:fightActions.rageExplosion} L'explosion de rage, libÃ©ration brutale d'une colÃ¨re accumulÃ©e ! Elle laisse exploser la rage accumulÃ©e durant le trajet vers l'ennemi. J'ai vu des guerriers transformer leur frustration en arme redoutable.",
      "{emote:fightActions.ramAttack} L'attaque bÃ©lier, technique de charge brutale aux effets un peu imprÃ©visibles ! Si l'attaquant n'est pas Ã©tourdi par l'attaque, il reÃ§oit une partie des dÃ©gÃ¢ts infligÃ©s. L'attaque peut Ã©galement Ã©tourdir l'adversaire. Il faut savoir accepter de souffrir pour faire souffrir.",
      "{emote:fightActions.resting} Le repos, technique de rÃ©cupÃ©ration fondamentale ! Elle s'applique sous forme de soin au lanceur et fonctionnera mieux si vous n'avez plus beaucoup d'Ã©nergie. Vous reposer vous permet Ã©galement d'arrÃªter vos saignements. Attention cependant : son pouvoir curatif est fortement diminuÃ© aprÃ¨s quatre utilisations. MÃªme le repos a ses limites.",
      "{emote:fightActions.roarAttack} Le rugissement, dÃ©monstration d'intimidation pure ! Il baisse l'attaque et la vitesse de l'adversaire. J'ai appris que parfois, la peur est plus efficace que l'acier.",
      "{emote:fightActions.rockShieldAttack} Le bouclier de roche, protection temporaire mais efficace, sur laquelle je me suis souvent cassÃ© les dents. Il rÃ©duit de moitiÃ© les dÃ©gÃ¢ts de la prochaine attaque subie. Une technique dÃ©fensive que j'ai vue sauver bien des monstres, et qui m'a bien des fois surprise par son Ã©tonnante efficacitÃ©.",
      "{emote:fightActions.sabotageAttack} L'attaque sabotage, technique sournoise mais efficace ! Elle ignore complÃ¨tement la dÃ©fense de l'adversaire et fonctionne mieux sur un adversaire ayant peu d'attaque. Peu coÃ»teuse en souffle mais peut paralyser le lanceur - si c'est le cas, les dÃ©gÃ¢ts sont augmentÃ©s.",
      "{emote:fightActions.shieldAttack} L'attaque bouclier, technique que j'ai perfectionnÃ©e durant mes annÃ©es de service ! Elle utilise la dÃ©fense de l'attaquant pour combattre, affaiblissant l'adversaire et divisant son attaque par trois durant deux tours. La meilleure dÃ©fense, c'est l'attaque !",
      "{emote:fightActions.simpleAttack} L'attaque simple... Une attaque simple, rien de plus Ã  en dire. Parfois, jeune aventurier, les bases restent les plus fiables.",
      "{emote:fightActions.slamAttack} L'attaque impact, une technique de ralentissement efficace ! C'est une attaque de puissance faible qui rÃ©duit la vitesse de l'adversaire. Ralentir son ennemi peut souvent Ãªtre plus prÃ©cieux que lui infliger de gros dÃ©gÃ¢ts.",
      "{emote:fightActions.stealth} La discrÃ©tion, un art de l'ombre que j'ai appris Ã  respecter ! Elle permet de se cacher discrÃ¨tement pour doubler les dÃ©gÃ¢ts de la prochaine attaque. L'effet de surprise ne doit jamais Ãªtre sous-estimÃ©, car il peut renverser le plus inÃ©gal des combats.",
      "{emote:fightActions.stoneSkinAttack} La peau de roche, technique de renforcement dÃ©fensif ! Plus cette action est effectuÃ©e Ã  la suite, plus le bonus de dÃ©fense devient important. La persÃ©vÃ©rance transforme la chair en pierre, littÃ©ralement.",
      "{emote:fightActions.summonAttack} L'invocation d'alliÃ©s, technique que j'ai vue employer par de puissants meneurs ! Elle invoque des alliÃ©s pour attaquer l'adversaire sauf s'il est dÃ©jÃ  victime d'une altÃ©ration d'Ã©tat. Ne peut Ãªtre utilisÃ©e qu'une seule fois par combat - il faut savoir choisir le bon moment.",
      "{emote:fightActions.tailWhipAttack} Le coup de queue, une attaque primitive mais efficace ! Cette puissante queue frappe l'adversaire, infligeant des dÃ©gÃ¢ts moyens avec une chance d'Ã©tourdir. J'ai appris Ã  me mÃ©fier de toute crÃ©ature dotÃ©e d'un tel appendice, car je peux vous assurer qu'un coup de cette ampleur en plein estomac aprÃ¨s un des festins du roi est loin d'Ãªtre agrÃ©able!",
      "{emote:fightActions.ultimateAttack} L'attaque ultime, la technique la plus puissante qu'un combattant puisse maÃ®triser ! Elle nÃ©cessite un tour de prÃ©paration et ne peut Ãªtre utilisÃ©e qu'une fois par combat. Quand vous la dÃ©ployez, assurez-vous que ce soit au bon moment, car elle ne rÃ©ussira que si vous Ãªtes au bout de vos forces et que vous n'avez plus beaucoup d'Ã©nergie.",
      "{emote:fightActions.webShotAttack} Le jet de toile est une technique de contrÃ´le Ã  distance ! Il envoie un jet de toile qui blesse et ralentit l'adversaire. J'ai vu cette technique transformer des adversaires rapides en proies faciles.",
      "{emote:fightActions.howlAttack} Le hurlement, technique d'auto-amÃ©lioration imprÃ©visible ! Le monstre pousse un hurlement qui augmente alÃ©atoirement son attaque, sa dÃ©fense ou sa vitesse. Parfois, laisser parler ses instincts primitifs peut Ãªtre payant.",
      "{emote:fightActions.icySeductionAttack} La sÃ©duction glaciale, technique pour le moins... particuliÃ¨re ! Elle utilise un charme envoÃ»tant et froid qui peut geler ou rendre confus l'adversaire en plus de lui infliger des dÃ©gÃ¢ts. J'ai appris Ã  me mÃ©fier de tous les types de charmes au combat.",
      "{emote:fightActions.frozenKissAttack} Le baiser gelÃ©, attaque aussi surprenante qu'efficace ! Elle consiste Ã  dÃ©poser un baiser glacial sur l'adversaire, infligeant des dÃ©gÃ¢ts. Si l'adversaire est dÃ©jÃ  gelÃ©, les dÃ©gÃ¢ts sont fortement rÃ©duits. Il existe dÃ©cidÃ©ment toutes sortes de techniques de combat...",
      "{emote:fightActions.spectralRevengeAttack} La revanche spectrale, riposte mystique que j'ai observÃ©e chez certains adversaires surnaturels ! Si la derniÃ¨re attaque subie n'Ã©tait pas magique, elle contre-attaque en infligeant des dÃ©gÃ¢ts Ã  son assaillant. L'au-delÃ  a ses propres rÃ¨gles de combat.",
      "{emote:fightActions.ambush} L'embuscade, technique de prÃ©paration tactique parfaite ! Elle prÃ©pare une embuscade qui rÃ©duit Ã  zÃ©ro les dÃ©gÃ¢ts de l'adversaire au prochain tour et augmente fortement les dÃ©gÃ¢ts du lanceur pour sa prochaine attaque. L'art de la guerre, c'est aussi savoir attendre le bon moment.",
      "{emote:fightActions.lightRayAttack} Le rayon de lumiÃ¨re, technique Ã©blouissante ! Un puissant faisceau lumineux est projetÃ© autour du monstre qui inflige des dÃ©gÃ¢ts Ã  l'adversaire et a une chance de le brÃ»ler ou de l'aveugler - l'aveuglement Ã©tant le plus frÃ©quent. La lumiÃ¨re peut Ãªtre une arme redoutable.",
      "{emote:fightActions.crystalShardAttack} L'attaque Ã©clat de cristal est une attaque Ã  distance prÃ©cise ! Cette technique inflige plus de dÃ©gÃ¢ts aux adversaires lents. J'ai appris que la prÃ©cision compte plus que la force brute avec ce type d'attaque.",
      "{emote:fightActions.clawAttack} L'attaque griffe, technique primitive mais directe ! Elle se base sur un violent coup de griffe. Simple, efficace, brutale - parfois les techniques les plus basiques sont les plus fiables.",
      "{emote:fightActions.callPack} L'appel Ã  la meute, technique de coordination que j'ai observÃ©e chez certaines crÃ©atures ! Elles appellent leur meute en attaquant faiblement dans un premier temps tout en prÃ©parant une ou plusieurs attaques de meute au tour suivant. L'union fait la force, mÃªme chez les bÃªtes.",
      "{emote:fightActions.packAttack} L'attaque de meute, dÃ©monstration de force collective ! Plus il y a de monstres, plus l'attaque est puissante. Elle peut se rÃ©pÃ©ter plusieurs fois. J'ai toujours dit que les nombres peuvent compenser bien des faiblesses individuelles.",
      "{emote:fightActions.glacialCaveCollapseAttack} L'effondrement glacial, technique environnementale impressionnante ! Elle fait s'effondrer des stalactites de glace depuis le plafond de la grotte, mais il est possible d'esquiver l'attaque en se rapprochant du lanceur par anticipation avec une attaque physique. Utiliser l'environnement comme arme, voilÃ  de la stratÃ©gie !",
      "{emote:fightActions.radiantBlastAttack} Le rayon radieux explosif, technique divine d'une puissance remarquable ! Elle fait partie du groupe des \"actions des dieux\". C'est une attaque radieuse en plusieurs tours : le lanceur concentre son Ã©nergie pendant deux tours pour libÃ©rer une puissante attaque de lumiÃ¨re, pouvant brÃ»ler ou aveugler l'adversaire.",
      "{emote:fightActions.hammerQuakeAttack} Le marteau sismique, technique divine de destruction massive ! Elle fait partie du groupe des \"actions des dieux\". Le lanceur frappe le sol avec une force titanesque, infligeant de lourds dÃ©gÃ¢ts Ã  tous les adversaires. Heureusement, il est possible d'esquiver les sÃ©ismes Ã  l'aide d'un familier volant.",
      "{emote:fightActions.startPolarEmbraceAttack} L'Ã©treinte polaire, technique de contrÃ´le glaciale redoutable ! Elle enserre la cible dans des griffes glacÃ©es, peut geler l'adversaire et prÃ©pare une Ã©treinte prolongÃ©e si l'adversaire ne se dÃ©fend pas Ã  l'aide d'une attaque Ã  distance. Une prise qu'il vaut mieux Ã©viter !",
      "{emote:fightActions.isStuckInPolarEmbrace} L'Ã©treinte polaire maintenue, continuation impitoyable de la prise prÃ©cÃ©dente ! Elle inflige des dÃ©gÃ¢ts Ã  l'adversaire agrippÃ© dans l'Ã©treinte, avec une chance de le geler. Elle Ã©choue si l'adversaire vient d'utiliser une attaque physique.",
      "{emote:fightActions.glacialBreathAttack} Le souffle glacial, technique Ã©lÃ©mentaire puissante ! Il libÃ¨re un vent glacÃ© qui inflige des dÃ©gÃ¢ts Ã  l'adversaire et a une chance de le geler si l'attaque touche. J'ai appris Ã  craindre le souffle des crÃ©atures des glaces.",
      "{emote:fightActions.blizzardRageAttack} La rage de blizzard, dÃ©chaÃ®nement Ã©lÃ©mentaire ultime ! Elle dÃ©chaÃ®ne les Ã©lÃ©ments glacÃ©s, pouvant geler, ralentir et affaiblir la dÃ©fense de l'adversaire. Utilisable une seule fois par combat - quand la nature se dÃ©chaÃ®ne dÃ©jÃ , il n'est pas possible de la faire se dÃ©chaÃ®ner plus !",
      "{emote:fightActions.aerialDiveAttack} La plongÃ©e aÃ©rienne, attaque venue du ciel ! Elle consiste Ã  fondre sur l'adversaire depuis les airs, mais Ã©choue si la cible vient d'attaquer Ã  distance. J'ai toujours dit qu'il fallait surveiller ses arriÃ¨res... et le ciel aussi !",
      "{emote:fightActions.crystallineArmorAttack} L'armure cristalline, technique dÃ©fensive offensive ! Elle utilise l'armure du combattant pour infliger des dÃ©gÃ¢ts, mais ne fonctionne que si l'adversaire vient de faire une attaque physique. Transformer sa protection en arme de riposte, voilÃ  de l'ingÃ©niositÃ© tactique !"

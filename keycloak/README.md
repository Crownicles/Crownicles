# Keycloak

Keycloak is the project used to authenticate users on Crownicles
## Setup the folder

Create the necessary folder for Keycloak data:
```sh
mkdir -p PROJECT_ROOT/keycloak/data/h2
```
### Linux 🐧  
You may need to adjust folder permissions to allow Keycloak to read and write the data:
```sh
chmod -R 755 PROJECT_ROOT/keycloak/data/h2 # May require sudo
```
If you still encounter permission issues, try:
```sh 
chmod -R 775 PROJECT_ROOT/keycloak/data/h2  # Less restrictive
```
## Start with docker

Before starting, **make sure** you are in the folder `src/keycloak/`.  

You can start Keycloak with docker using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can find the docker-compose file here:
[docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) 

## Configuring a realm

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/master/console/ (Default credentials are admin/admin)

First click on the create realm button:

Import the already configured realm: [realm.json](realm.json):

![import-realm.png](images/import-realm.png)

Configure your Discord config.toml:

You will need to regenerate a client secret here on keycloak:

Manage -> Clients -> discord -> Credentials -> Client Secret -> Regenerate

## Logging in with Discord

The imported realm ships a `discord` identity provider, so Keycloak talks to Discord itself and the
front-ends only ever run a standard Authorization Code + PKCE flow against Keycloak. Adding another
way to sign in later is a matter of declaring one more provider here, with no change in the clients.

Two values are environment specific and are therefore left as placeholders in `realm.json`:

1. In *Identity providers -> Discord*, replace `TO_REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and
   `TO_REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` with the credentials of your Discord application.
2. Copy the *Redirect URI* displayed on that same page and add it to the *Redirects* list of your
   application in the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). It
   looks like `http://127.0.0.1:8080/realms/Crownicles/broker/discord/endpoint`. Use the address the
   client will actually reach, not `127.0.0.1`, when testing from a phone.

The provider uses the generic `oauth2` type because Discord is not an OpenID Connect provider: it
returns opaque tokens, so Keycloak reads the profile from `https://discord.com/api/users/@me`.

### Account matching

Accounts created by the Discord bot are named `discord-<discord id>`. The provider reproduces that
name through its *username* mapper, and its first login flow (`auto link first login`) links the
brokered login to that existing account instead of creating a second one. Changing either the mapper
template or the flow would cut existing players from their progress.
